- On clicking the restaurant, it should navigate to the details page. Show all the relevant information, and make the page as unique as possible.
- The details page must have a reviews section which should display only 5 reviews with a more button. On clicking more button, navigate to a reviews page showing all reviews. Implement pagination on this page.
- Implement a Like feature for the restaurants. User must be able to like or unlike the
